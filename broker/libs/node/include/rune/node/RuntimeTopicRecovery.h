//
// Boot-time recovery of RUNTIME-defined topics.
//
// A topic created at runtime — by DefineTopic, or as a CreateView sink — exists
// as a runtime replica only because the admin→control createTopic path built it
// (TopicRegistry::createTopic + BrokerNode::createRuntimeUserReplicas).  Its log
// survives a restart, but nothing at boot re-creates the topic: boot builds
// ONLY config_.topics.  The durable record of each runtime topic lives in the
// admin catalogs instead:
//   - __topic_schemas : one TopicSchema per (topicId, version) — DefineTopic
//   - __views         : one ViewRecord per view — the view's sink topic
//
// recoverRuntimeTopicSpecs() reads both catalogs straight off disk (BEFORE the
// TopicRegistry is built, on the single startup thread) and synthesizes exactly
// the TopicSpec each original createTopic call used, so the caller can append
// them to config_.topics and every existing boot path (TopicRegistry,
// buildReplication, worker placement, MetadataService, read-committed rebuild)
// recreates them like static topics.  A transient topic (TopicSchema
// persistence trailer) is recreated transient: metadata survives, data does not.
//
// Bound: each catalog is read to its recovered LOG END.  The admin catalogs are
// single-owner, and every DDL record is HW-gated before the client is acked, so
// the on-disk tail is committed (Phase 1 is single-node; multi-node catalog
// replication is the deferred §11 boundary).
